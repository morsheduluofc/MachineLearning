# Different Machine Learning Algorithms
This project has different regression and classification algorithms. Data of all projects are stored in Data folder.

## Regression Algorithms:
* Linear Regression: We will predict house price based on available features. See LinearRegression.ipynb file
* Polynomial Regression: We will predict salary based on year of experience. See PolynomialRegression.ipynb file
* Support Vector Regression: We will predict marks based on hours of study. See SupportVectorRegression.ipynb file
* Decision Tress Regression: We will predict revenue based on temperature from Icecream Data using tree-based regression. See TreeForestRegression.ipynb file
* Random Forest Regression: We will predict revenue based on temperature from Icecream Data using random forest-based regression. See TreeForestRegression.ipynb file

## Classification Algorithms:
* Naive Bayes algorithm: We find whether a user buys a product by clicking the ad on the site based on their salary, age, and gender. This is a cclassification problem. See NaiveBayes.ipynb file 
* kNN Classifier: We find the species of Iris based on four features. See kNNClassifier.ipynb file
* SVM Classifer: We use the cancer dataset to classify the user. See SVMClassifer.ipynb file
* Decision Tress Classifer: We use the diabetes dataset to predict the diabetes of the patients. See DecisionTreeClassifier.ipynb file
* Random Forest Classifer:
