# Different Machine Learning Algorithms
This project has different regression and classification algorithms. Data of all projects are stored in Data folder.

## Regression Algorithms:
* Linear Regression: We will predict the house price based on available features. See the LinearRegression.ipynb file
* Polynomial Regression
* Support Vector Regression
* Decision Tress Regression
* Random Forest Regression

## Classification Algorithms:
* Naive Bayes algorithm
* kNN Classifier
* SVM Classifer
* Decision Tress Classifer
* Random Forest Classifer
