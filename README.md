# Machine Learning Algorithms
This project uses different regression and classification algorithms to predict the value and classify the data. Dataset are stored in the 'Data' folder.

## Regression Algorithms:
* Linear Regression: It will predict house price based on available features (e.g., number of bedroom, bathroom, floor etc.) by using Linear Regression. See the implementation in LinearRegression.ipynb file.
* Polynomial Regression: It will predict the salary of an employee based on the year of experiences by using Polynomial Regression. See the implementation in PolynomialRegression.ipynb file.
* Support Vector Regression: It will predict marks based on the hours of study by using Support Vector Regression. See the implementation in SupportVectorRegression.ipynb file.
* Decision Tress Regression: It will predict the revenue based on temperature from the Icecream dataset by using Decision Tress Regression. See the implementation in TreeForestRegression.ipynb file
* Random Forest Regression: It will predict the revenue based on the temperature from Icecream dataset by using Random Forest Regression. See the implementation in TreeForestRegression.ipynb file

## Classification Algorithms:
* Naive Bayes algorithm: It will find whether a user buys a product or not by clicking an ad on a site based on their salary, age, and gender. This is a classification problem and see NaiveBayes.ipynb file for details implementation. 
* kNN Classifier: It will find the species of an Iris based on its four features. See kNNClassifier.ipynb file for details implementation.
* SVM Classifer: It will use the cancer dataset to classify the user. See SVMClassifer.ipynb file for details implementation.
* Decision Tress Classifer: It will use diabetes dataset to predict the diabetes of a patient. See DecisionTreeClassifier.ipynb file for details implementation.
* Random Forest Classifer: It will use weather dataset to predict the weather. See RandomForestClassifier.ipynb file for details implementation.
